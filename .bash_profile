# Automatically drop into fish (the Friendly Interactive SHell)
#   I do this here instead of changing my default shell on each system because
#   I work with several machines that do complicated stuff in the system bash
#   profile (not in my control)
#   Also because this only runs in login shells I can manually start a Bash
#   shell without then getting thrown straight into fish
exec fish
