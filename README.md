# Personal dotfiles

This repository and its contents draw heavily from Mathias's dotfiles, an absolutely excellent but humongously overwhelming collection that covers just about every conceivable dotfile use-case. Rather than paring down his collection I've chosen to build upwards, selecting bits and pieces as necessary to serve my own needs.
