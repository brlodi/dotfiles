# Personal dotfiles

This repository and its contents draw heavily from Mathias's dotfiles, an absolutely excellent but humongously overwhelming collection that covers just about every conceivable dotfile usecase. Rather than paring down his net I've chosen to build upwards, selecting bits and pieces as necessary to serve my own needs.
