# Personal dotfiles

These are just my personal dotfiles, for my macOS setup intended for light development and
day-to-day use. You're welcome to fork this if you find it useful, although I fully subscribe to the
school that says you should be taking inspiration from others but building your own dotfiles, not
blindly copying some stranger's from the internet.
